- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin http://git.fa.edu.vn/hn25_cpl_pjb_01/hn25_cpl_pjb_01_g2/rent-car.git
git branch -M main
