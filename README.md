## Tech stack
* Build tool: maven >= 3.9.0
* Java: 17
* Framework: Spring boot 3.4.2
* DBMS: MySql 8.0.41, Redis 7.4.2
* Reverse Proxy: Nginx

## Prerequisites to run application
* Java JDK 17
* Docker engine

## Run Docker compose
In the root directory of the project, run
  `docker compose up -d`

After run docker compose, you should run the following command to check whether the config of redis RDB and AOF is right
```
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
INFO Persistence
CONFIG GET notify-keyspace-events
```
If you see `aof_enabled:1`, `rdb_changes_since_last_save`,`1) "notify-keyspace-events"` and
`2) "xE"` then every thing is alright!
